# Assessing the influence of soil parameters in the Climate Land Model version 5 using empirical orthogonal function

This repository contains the code and data used in the study on assessing the influence of soil parameters in the Climate Land Model version 5 (CLM5) using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The study investigates the correlation between various soil properties and their impact on key climate variables predicted by CLM5. EOF analysis is used to identify dominant patterns of spatial variability in the soil parameters and their relationship with the climate variables.

## Data

The data used in this study is publicly available from the [CLM5 model repository](ftp://sp-mip-up:sp-mip2017.upload@data.iac.ethz.ch).

## Code

The code used in this study is written in Python and is organized into Jupyter notebook and Python script. These notebooks walk through the data processing, analysis, and visualization steps used in the study, while the python script contains the empirical orthogonal function computations. 

## Results

The results of the study are presented in the jupyter notebook. This includes figures from the analysis.
